# Improving efficiency of human-robot collaborative search in unknown environments using human behavior estimation and bidirectional communication

### About
This is a Bachelor's Degree thesis describing the robot behavior that was created to aid in collaborative search tasks.
The robot used was Toyota's Human Support Robot 26 (HSR26), and experiments were held in Unity simulations.
The paper describes the methodology, results and areas of improvement for future collaborative search tasks.
